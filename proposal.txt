This proposal aims to focus on improving the quality of healthcare services, particularly towards paramedics. 
There are rare cases of patients having unusual, but life threatening symptoms that are needed to be addressed in the hospitals capable enough to facilitate them. 
To address this issue, the proposed software captures or queries details regarding the nature of the patient. 
Once analyzed, the program is supposed to recommend which other medical facilities / hospitals 
(aside from the original establishment the paramedics arrived from) are capable of handling them.
